#URL Redirector
 
 * Index Page to list all the URLs that are present in the system
    
    * Pagination?
 
 * Submit Page/Form to accept URLs and shorten it
  
 * Redirection controller-model-feature that fetches the expanded URL from the DB and redirects to the appropriate page
  
 * Maybe some fancy click+copy JS plugin?
